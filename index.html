          Hello stranger!. If you are here, it’s either because you want to know a little bit more about me, Javier Diaz (J.D.), or you want to check my website developing skills. So here is a bit of my story.
      </p>
      <p>
          I come from a little Spanish town called Avila, famous for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_%C3%81vila" target="_blank">magnificent medieval wall</a>and many catholic churches. Although Avila is a wonderful place to grow up in, once I graduated the high school, I felt that my future was somewhere else, where I can pursue a career in science. The obvious choice was to move to the capital, where I was accepted at the <a href="http://www.ucm.es" target="_blank">Complutense University of Madrid</a> and after a few years obtained a degree in Chemical Science, with focus on Material Science. 
      </p>
      <p>
         On the last year, I joined the course of Computational Chemistry, where I met my first programming language, MathLab. I got fascinated by the amount of liberty a mathematical oriented programming language offered to develop your ideas and projects. This first contact make me start looking at computer programming with new eyes but when I finish my degree, I started looking for a job related to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless all my plans where crashed by the economical crisis on Spain. To improve my English and earn enough money to continue my growth as a scientist and developer, I decided to emigrate to Norway and I started working in a hotel near Tromsø. Soon after moving there I met my girlfriend, a born traveller, who imbued me with the traveling bug. 
      </p>
      <p>
       A year later, we decide to give a chance to become remote workers. We moved to Trondheim and we started to focus on building our brand, <a href="http://wwww.instagram.com/inspiredbytravel1" target="_blank">Inspired By Travel</a>. And while I studied web development, Python, video and photography edition, my girlfriend focus on SEO, social networking and copy writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, we are ready to move to the next step, and be fully remote. Been able to work wherever and whenever, without the burdens of being tie to an office or a single place.
       That's the dream and that's what this page is here for, to prove my skills.
